      <h1>Bud Rot</h1>
      <p>
        Bud Rot, caused by the fungus <i>Phytophthora palmivora</i>, is a serious disease that affects coconut trees, 
        leading to the rotting of the central bud and potentially killing the tree. Early detection and appropriate 
        management are crucial to saving affected trees.
      </p>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pruning and Removal: Immediately remove and burn the infected fronds and the central bud to prevent the spread of the disease 
          to healthy trees. In the early stages of infection, cutting away the affected parts might save the tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fungicide Treatment: Apply a fungicide like Bordeaux mixture (1% solution) or Copper oxychloride to the affected area. 
          Drench the crown and surrounding soil with the fungicide to kill the pathogen in the soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improving Drainage: Ensure proper drainage in the plantation area to reduce waterlogging, 
          which creates a favorable environment for the fungus.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Recommended Fertilizers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Organic Fertilizer: <strong>Neem Cake</strong> – Acts as both a fertilizer and a natural pesticide, 
          improving tree health and reducing the likelihood of fungal infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chemical Fertilizer: <strong>Potassium Sulfate (K2SO4)</strong> – Apply 500g to 1kg per tree, 
          depending on the age of the tree, to enhance resistance to diseases and improve overall growth.
        </li>
      </ul>
